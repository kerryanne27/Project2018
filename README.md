# Project2018
This project is for the Programming and Scripting Class. The project can be defined as the research and programming of the Iris Data Set.

Sir Ronald Fisher was a British Statistician and Geneticist, he introduced the Iris Data set to the world in 1936.The data was physically gathered by Edgar Anderson and it contains the petal measurements of 150 Iris flower, equally divided amongst 3 different varieties - The Iris Sertosa, iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. 
The data set was originally introduced and used in the paper : The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. Linear discriminant Analysis or LDA is the study of something to identify similar traits, measurements, behaviours or variances that can classify it into a group.

In todays world of computer Science when algorithms are being devised the Iris data set is used to test and prove the validity of the programme it is also used as an input in the early stages of algorithm writting to examine how various technologies sort and handle data sets.

It has notably been used to test the IBM Watson analytics engine.


The programes win this file will calculate the following: 

>Average
>Median
>Mode
>Range
>Standard Deviation

I will run a program that plots the flowers on a histogram based on the petal sepal lenghth and width.

I will also construct a program that can define the iris flower category a petal length and width most likely belongs to. 
This can be tested by inputting and random measurements.
